YouTube-Search is a React-based application that allows a user to obtain an listing of YouTube videos and accompanying video player, based on a given search term.  This application helped build proficiency with props, state management, and utilizing API calls with React to obtain videos and utilizes form development.

I designed this application to build proficency with React props, state, and utilizing React features to make API calls to retrieve third-party data.
